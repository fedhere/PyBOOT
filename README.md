this is all the material developed for the CUSP NYU 2016-2017 Python Bootcamp and updated for following years through 202 for the SPPA667 Biden School of Public Policy and Administration class 2020.
 All the material is designed by me (taking much inspiration a number of internet resources including [http://software-carpentry.org/](http://software-carpentry.org/), [http://www.practicepython.org/](http://www.practicepython.org/) and many more.

 The list of topics I wanted to cover is in [bootcampNB.md](bootcampNB.md); entries written in bold were not covered
 
 A single notebook with the code written in class was generated : [inclassNB2016.ipynb](inclassNB2016.ipynb) [inclassNB2017.ipynb](inclassNB2017.ipynb)
 
 I added an exercise to practice for loops, and printing : [LoopExercise.ipynb](LoopExercise.ipynb)

 There is also an exercise to practice for loops, and practice scripting, inline arguments, exception handling, and the time module, but we did not get to most of those topics: [printGoodmorningGoodnightExercise.py](printGoodmorningGoodnightExercise.py)
